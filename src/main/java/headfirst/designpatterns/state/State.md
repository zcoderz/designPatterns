State pattern is used to have different behaviors based on the state of an application.
The behavior is controlled by a class that handles behavior of a specific state. 

For example, ring behavior of a phone can be managed easily by a state pattern.
Where the state of the phone can be any of silent, vibrate or ring. Then
depending on the state of the phone the appropriate behavior is executed by the given state.
