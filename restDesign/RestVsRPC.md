Rest APIs are scalable. They are simple and standardized making them easy to use.
Rest is built over http which is well understood. Rest provides fast performance
via its caching ability (client or edge). 

However, rest has a heavy payload. 

RPC has light payloads and high performance. 
RPC isn't standardized and requires enterprise software which maybe expensive.
